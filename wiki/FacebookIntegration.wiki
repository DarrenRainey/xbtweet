= Introduction =

You can easily integrate xbTweet with Facebook. This is done by creating a link between Twitter and Facebook with an external app.

= Details =

There are several apps out there on the market, but I recommend <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/">Selective Twitter</a> which is a small app that checks for tweets ending with #fb to include in your Facebook timeline.
It's really small and quiet and does exactly what you're after, nothing more.

After you create the Twitter-Facebook link, you need to customize your tweets in the script's settings page.
As long as your custom tweet will end with #fb it will be displayed on Facebook.

That's it, you're linked to Twitter and Facebook.
