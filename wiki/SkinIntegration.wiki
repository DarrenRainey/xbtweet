Linking between XBMC's skins and xbTweet

= Introduction =
xbTweet supports skin integration and using the script while watching a video or listening to a song.

= Details =
In order to integrate xbTweet with any skin, first it needs to support it. I'm going to show how this can be managed under the Transparency! skin.
	* First you need to open the Skin's settings page under the general settings.
	* On the left side menu you'll notice 'Scripts' on the list. 
	* Under scripts, tick the top checkbox for "Show subtitle script button in OSD' and navigate to where you saved your script in the 'Script path' box.
	* Do the same for 'Show lyrics script button in OSD'
	* Now you can tweet away from within you video or music player. Just press the appropriate button 'Subtitles' when watching videos and 'Lyrics' when listening to your songs.
Check this screen shot for the correct settings.
