<h2>XBOX and Linux users</h2>
Due to some limitations with the browsing capabilities of your stations and xbmc's embedded python version, you may experience issues with obtaining a PIN code from Twitter.<br>
In order to workaround this I created the <a href='http://www.xbmcblog.com/xbTweet/OAuth.aspx'>following page</a>, after you'll complete the OAuth process, please input the PIN into your xbtweet dialog when prompted.<br>

<h2>Current Development Stage</h2>
I've reached a point where I believe xbtweet is a stable script that provides outgoing Twitter notifications. It covers most basic features and I now moved on to further development based on request.<br>
Therefore, if you think that more can be done and you want to suggest more features, please forward your comments to: <a href='mailto:itay.weinberger@gmail.com'>itay.weinberger@gmail.com</a>
